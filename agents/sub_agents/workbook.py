The activities are for {cfg['newspaper']} students (CEFR {cfg['cefr']}, {cfg['target']}).

Key vocabulary from the article: {vocab_list}

Guidelines for EACH set:
1. Vocabulary Activity
   - Use the key vocabulary words listed above
   - Activities must be educational and appropriately challenging
   - Do NOT reuse the same answers or content across Set 1 and Set 2

2. True/False sentences (4 sentences)
   - Based on the article content
   - Mix of true and false (at least 1 of each)
   - No overlap in content or answers between Set 1 and Set 2

3. Comprehension Questions (3 questions)
   - Must require paragraph-length answers (not one-word or one-fact answers)
   - Questions must ask for explanation, comparison, or inference
   - No overlap in questions between Set 1 and Set 2

4. Discussion Questions (3 questions)
   - Open-ended and thought-provoking
   - At least ONE question must ask for a personal opinion or experience
   - No overlap in questions between Set 1 and Set 2

Before finalizing, double-check all activities for flow, consistency, grammar,
and make sure Set 1 and Set 2 do not overlap in answers or content.
